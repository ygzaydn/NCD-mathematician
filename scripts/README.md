# Scripts

This project has its own frontend, which means that you have to obtain score to get points, but for a case I've simulated scripts that user has 100 points. On this directory, you can 2 script files. 

	-	`deploy.sh` deploys contract to your own account if you want to.
	-	`contract.sh` simulates the game as you've get 100points, so you've earned 1NEAR as prize.
